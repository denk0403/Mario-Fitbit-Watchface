# Mario Fitbit Watchface

A simple watchface to show your appreciation for Mario! Set your birthday in the settings and when the day comes, Mario will celebrate with you! 

Also, if you leave your phone somewhere without noticing, the watchface will notify you with an alert and haptics that it has disconnected.

Inspired by: https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/55431083b7d4a71c0000003b.

And thank you to [mourner](https://github.com/mourner) for his open-source [Suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) library used to calculate the times for sunset and sunrise.
